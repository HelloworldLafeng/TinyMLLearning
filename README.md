# TinyML Learning Repository

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to learning the MIT course "TinyML and Efficient Deep Learning Computing" taught by Professor Song Han and colleagues. The repository is organized to facilitate learning, note-taking, and project implementation.

## Repository Structure
- **Notes/**: Contains lecture notes and summaries
  - Each lecture will have its own markdown file or folder
  - Code snippets and key concepts will be documented here
- **Projects/**: Contains practical implementations and assignments
  - Each project will have its own dedicated folder
  - Projects will implement concepts learned from the course
